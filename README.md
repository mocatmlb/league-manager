# District 8 Travel League Management System

## Overview

The District 8 Travel League Management System is a PHP-based web application designed to replace the legacy PHP/FormTools-based website with an improved, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing youth baseball leagues. Built specifically for shared hosting environments, the system provides comprehensive functionality for team management, game scheduling, score tracking, and league administration.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- **PHP 8.0+** (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or native installation)
- **MySQL/MariaDB 5.5+** (included with XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP)
- **Apache Web Server** (included with XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP)
- **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)
- **Git** for version control

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/d8tl.git
cd d8tl/mvp-app

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Copy and configure environment
cp includes/config.example.php includes/config.php
# Edit config.php with your local database settings

# Create database and import schema
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE d8tl_local;"
mysql -u root -p d8tl_local < database/schema.sql

# Start local development server
# Option 1: Use your local Apache (point to mvp-app/public directory)
# Option 2: Use PHP built-in server
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```

**Access the application:**
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000 (or your Apache virtual host)
- **Admin Console**: http://localhost:8000/admin/
- **Coach Portal**: http://localhost:8000/coaches/

### Default Login Credentials (Local Development)
- **Admin Password**: `admin` (change in production)
- **Coach Password**: `coaches` (change in production)

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Git Deployment Setup Guide](./GIT_DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md).

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- **A Small Orange Shared Hosting** with cPanel access
- **PHP 8.0+** (configurable via cPanel PHP Selector)
- **MariaDB/MySQL 5.5+** (included with hosting)
- **Git Version Control** (available in cPanel)
- **SMTP Email** (included with hosting or external service)
- **Composer** (available on hosting platform)

### Git-Based Deployment Strategy

The system uses **automated Git-based deployment** with staging and production environments:

- **Production**: `district8travelleague.com` (main branch)
- **Staging**: `staging.district8travelleague.com` (staging branch)
- **Development**: Local environment (develop branch)

### Environment Configuration

Configure environment-specific settings in PHP configuration files:

**Production Configuration** (`includes/config.prod.php`):
```php
<?php
// Database Configuration - Production (MUST BE CONFIGURED)
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_DATABASE_NAME');
define('DB_USER', 'REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_DB_USERNAME');
define('DB_PASS', 'REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_DB_PASSWORD');

// Application Configuration
define('APP_NAME', 'District 8 Travel League');
define('APP_URL', 'https://district8travelleague.com');
define('APP_ENV', 'production');

// Email Configuration
define('SMTP_HOST', 'mail.asmallorange.com');
define('SMTP_USERNAME', 'REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_EMAIL_ADDRESS');
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_EMAIL_PASSWORD');

// Security Settings (CRITICAL: MUST BE CHANGED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)
define('DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD', 'REPLACE_WITH_STRONG_ADMIN_PASSWORD_MIN_12_CHARS');
define('DEFAULT_COACHES_PASSWORD', 'REPLACE_WITH_STRONG_COACHES_PASSWORD_MIN_12_CHARS');
?>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE**: All placeholder values MUST be replaced with actual credentials before deployment. Never commit real credentials to version control.

### Deployment Workflow

#### 1. Initial Setup
1. **Set up cPanel Git repositories** for production and staging
2. **Create databases** via cPanel MySQL Databases
3. **Configure environment files** with production credentials
4. **Import database schema** via phpMyAdmin

#### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes and commit
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Deploy to staging for testing
git checkout staging
git merge develop
git push origin staging
# Automatic deployment to staging.district8travelleague.com

# Deploy to production (after testing)
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
# Manual deployment via cPanel Git Version Control
```

#### 3. Automated Deployment Features
- **Database Migrations**: Automatic schema updates during deployment
- **Dependency Management**: Composer dependencies installed automatically
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings applied
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment verification of system functionality
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick recovery from deployment issues

### cPanel Deployment Process
1. **Navigate to cPanel ‚Üí Git Version Control**
2. **Select repository** (production or staging)
3. **Click "Pull or Deploy"** to trigger deployment
4. **Monitor deployment logs** for success/failure
5. **Verify application functionality** post-deployment

### Security Configuration

#### Critical Security Steps (MANDATORY)

1. **Replace All Placeholder Credentials**: Before any deployment, replace ALL placeholder values in configuration files:
   - Database credentials in `config.prod.php` and `config.staging.php`
   - SMTP email credentials
   - Default admin and coach passwords

2. **Use Strong Passwords**: 
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Unique passwords for each environment

3. **Secure File Permissions**: Ensure configuration files are not publicly accessible:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 mvp-app/includes/config.*.php
   ```

4. **Never Commit Real Credentials**: The `.gitignore` file prevents accidental commits of:
   - Database backups
   - Real configuration files
   - Log files with sensitive data

#### Security Features

- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration with HTTP-only cookies
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords use PHP's `password_hash()` function
- **Input Sanitization**: Database queries use prepared statements
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for admin and coach areas

### Initial Setup

1. **Access Application**: Navigate to your deployed URL
2. **Admin Console Login**: Use admin password from configuration
3. **Change Default Passwords**: Update admin and coach passwords immediately
4. **Create First Program**: Set up your first sports program (e.g., "Baseball")
5. **Create Season**: Add the current season to your program
6. **Configure Divisions**: Set up divisions within your season
7. **Configure Email Settings**: Set up SMTP configuration for notifications

### Security Considerations

- **Change Default Passwords**: Immediately change all default passwords in production
- **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS in production with SSL certificates from hosting provider
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- **Database Security**: Use strong database passwords and limit user privileges
- **Configuration Protection**: Sensitive files protected via .htaccess rules
- **Regular Updates**: Keep PHP and Composer dependencies updated
