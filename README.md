cp includes/config.example.php includes/config.php
# Edit config.php with your local database settings

# Create database and import schema
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE d8tl_local;"
mysql -u root -p d8tl_local < database/schema.sql

# Start local development server
# Option 1: Use your local Apache (point to public directory)
# Option 2: Use PHP built-in server
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```

#### Access the Application
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:8000 (or your Apache virtual host)

#### Default Login Credentials (Local Development)
- **Admin Password**: `admin` (change in production)
- **Coach Password**: `coaches` (change in production)

### Remote Installation (A Small Orange Git Deployment)

The system uses **automated Git-based deployment** with A Small Orange shared hosting for production and staging environments.

#### Prerequisites
- **A Small Orange Shared Hosting** with cPanel access
- **PHP 8.0+** (configurable via cPanel PHP Selector)
- **MariaDB/MySQL 5.5+** (included with hosting)
- **Git Version Control** (available in cPanel)
- **SMTP Email** (included with hosting or external service)

#### Quick Deployment
1. **Set up cPanel Git repositories** for production and staging
2. **Create databases** via cPanel MySQL Databases
3. **Configure environment files** with production credentials
4. **Import database schema** via phpMyAdmin
5. **Deploy via cPanel Git Version Control**

For detailed step-by-step remote installation instructions, see the **[Git Deployment Setup Guide](./GIT_DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md)**.

#### Environment Configuration
- **Production**: `http://district8travelleague.com` (main branch)
- **Staging**: `http://staging.district8travelleague.com` (staging branch)
- **Development**: Local environment (develop branch)

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE**: All placeholder values in configuration files MUST be replaced with actual credentials before deployment. Never commit real credentials to version control.

## Troubleshooting: GitHub 403 when cloning or pushing

If you see an error like:

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/mocatmlb/league-manager.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

Try the following:
- Use SSH instead of HTTPS (recommended):
  - Ensure you have an SSH key added to your GitHub account.
  - Clone with: git clone git@github.com:mocatmlb/league-manager.git
- If using HTTPS, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password:
  - Create a PAT with repo scope in GitHub.
  - When prompted for a password, paste the PAT. Avoid a trailing slash in the URL.
- Remove the trailing slash after .git in the URL:
  - Correct: https://github.com/mocatmlb/league-manager.git
  - Incorrect: https://github.com/mocatmlb/league-manager.git/
- Verify you have access to the repository (collaborator/team membership).
- Update an existing remote that has the wrong URL:
  - git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mocatmlb/league-manager.git
- Clear cached HTTPS credentials if switching to PAT:
  - macOS: Keychain Access → search for github.com → delete the GitHub entry.
  - Windows: Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → github.com → Remove.
  - Linux: depends on your credential helper; or run: git config --global --unset credential.helper
- For cPanel Git Version Control, prefer SSH with a Deploy Key:
  - Generate an SSH key in cPanel or locally and add the public key to GitHub (Deploy keys for the repo or your account keys).
  - Use the SSH clone URL in cPanel: git@github.com:mocatmlb/league-manager.git
- If your org enforces SSO, ensure the PAT is authorized for the org.
